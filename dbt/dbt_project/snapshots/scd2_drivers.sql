--  scd2_drivers
--
--  Tracks historical changes to driver attributes over time,
--  most importantly: status, rating, vehicle assignments, and zone.
--
--  dbt adds these columns automatically:
--    dbt_scd_id      → unique surrogate key per version row
--    dbt_updated_at  → when dbt processed this version
--    dbt_valid_from  → timestamp this version became active
--    dbt_valid_to    → timestamp this version was superseded (NULL = current)
--
--  Common analytical queries:
--    - How many drivers transitioned from ACTIVE → SUSPENDED in Q1?
--    - What was driver X's status on a specific date?
--    - Which drivers changed vehicle type more than once?
